Python makes development and debugging fast because no compilation step is included in Python development, and the edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.

Python has many web-based assets, open-source projects, and a vibrant community. 

Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.

Python has many third-party libraries that can be used to make its functionality easier. These libraries cover many domains, for example, web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.
